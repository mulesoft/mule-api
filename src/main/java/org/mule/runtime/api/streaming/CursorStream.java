/**
 * An {@link InputStream} which provides random access.
 * <p>
 * It works by adding the concept of a zero-based position. Each position
 * represents one byte in the stream. Each time data is pulled from this stream,
 * the position advances as many bytes as read. However, the {@link #seek(long)}
 * method can be used to reset the position.
 * <p>
 * This streams are auto-closeable in the sense that once a read operation returns {@code -1},
 * the {@link #isClosed()} method will start to return {@core true}. However, an invokation to
 * {@link #seek(long)} will mark {@code this} cursor as open again.
 * <p>
 * Eventually, the runtime (and only the runtime) will dispose of this cursor, releasing the
 * resources it has allocated. Once that happens, {@link #isClosed()} will return {@code true}
 * again but no action will move it from that state. When this happens, {@link #isDisposed()}
 * will also return {@code true}
 * <p>
 * Implementations should not be expected to be thread safe. Should not be used concurrently.
