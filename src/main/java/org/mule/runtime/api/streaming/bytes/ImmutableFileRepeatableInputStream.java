/**
 * An {@link InputStream} implementation that allows obtaining a repeatable stream from the contents of an immutable file that
 * already exists in the local file system.
 * <p>
 * The Mule Runtime is capable of generating larger than memory repeatable streams by buffering into a temporal file in the local
 * file system. The problem with that approach is that when the contents of the original stream are already present in the file
 * system, the temporary file is still created, consuming unnecessary disk space and IO time.
 * <p>
 * This class allows to generate an {@link InputStream} from a local file that the repeatable streaming engine will buffer
 * from instead of generating a new one.
 * <p>
 * Immutability is a <b>MANDATORY PRECONDITION</b> for using this class.
 * The file <b>WILL NOT</b> be modified by this class or the Mule streaming framework in any way. But at the same time,
 * the file's immutability needs to be guaranteed, at least for the duration of this stream's lifecycle. This means that while
 * the file is in use by instances of this class, no other process or thread can modify the file's content. Failing to meet this
 * condition will result in dirty reads and content corruption. If this condition cannot be assured, then use a regular
 * {@link FileInputStream} instead.
 * <p>
 * Also keep in mind that the purpose of this class is to optimize repeatable streaming resources on certain cases. However,
 * in the context of a Mule application, the user can always decide to disable repeatable streaming, in which case, this stream
 * will not be treated in a repeatable manner. The user can also configure an in-memory streaming strategy, in which case the
 * behavior will be similar to using a {@link FileInputStream}.
 * <p>
 * Finally, notice that this stream is not auto closeable. {@link #close()} method needs to be invoked explicitly.
 *
 * @since 1.3.0
