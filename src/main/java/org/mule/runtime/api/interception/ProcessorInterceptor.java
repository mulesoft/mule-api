/**
 * Provides a way to hook behavior around a component that is not a
 * {@link org.mule.runtime.api.component.TypedComponentIdentifier.ComponentType#SOURCE SOURCE}. Implementations may implement the
 * {@link #before(ComponentLocation, Map, InterceptionEvent) before} method, the
 * {@link #around(ComponentLocation, Map, InterceptionEvent, InterceptionAction) around} method and the
 * {@link #after(ComponentLocation, InterceptionEvent, Optional) after} method (by default,
 * {@link #before(ComponentLocation, Map, InterceptionEvent) before} and
 * {@link #after(ComponentLocation, InterceptionEvent, Optional) after} do nothing and
 * {@link #around(ComponentLocation, Map, InterceptionEvent, InterceptionAction) around} just calls
 * {@link InterceptionAction#proceed() proceed} on the action).
 * <p>
 * Interceptable components are those that are defined by a configuration element and have a {@link ComponentLocation}.
 * <p>
 * Each component for which a {@link ProcessorInterceptor} is applicable will have its own instance of that
 * {@link ProcessorInterceptor}. For instance, assuming there is a class {@code MyInterceptor} that implements
 * {@link ProcessorInterceptor} and 2 different components for which {@code MyInterceptor} is applicable, there will be 2
 * different instances of {@code MyInterceptor}, one intercepting each of the component. Since different executions on the same
 * processor will use the same interceptor, it is advisable for implementations to be stateless. State can be simulated by keeping
 * method local variables in the {@link #around(ComponentLocation, Map, InterceptionEvent, InterceptionAction) around} method if
 * required.
 * <p>
 * A component may have more than one interceptor applied. In that case, all will be applied in a predetermined order, calling the
 * {@link #before(ComponentLocation, Map, InterceptionEvent) before} methods of each,
 * {@link #around(ComponentLocation, Map, InterceptionEvent, InterceptionAction) around} methods which may proceed to the next
 * interceptor or the component itself and finally the {@link #after(ComponentLocation, InterceptionEvent, Optional) after}
 * methods.

   * continue and eventually call the intercepted component. Otherwise, by calling {@link InterceptionAction#skip() skip()} the

   * @param parameters the parameters of the component as defined in the configuration. Parameters that contain expressions will

   * @param event an object that contains the state of the event to be sent to the component. It may be modified by calling its
   *        mutator methods.
   * @param action when something other than continuing the interception is desired, the corresponding method on this object must
   *        be called. The methods on this object return a {@link CompletableFuture} that may be used to return from this method.
   * @return a non-null {@link CompletableFuture} for modifying the intercepted {@link InterceptionEvent event} after this method
