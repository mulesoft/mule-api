/**
 * Creates and manages {@link ObjectStore} instances.
 * <p>
 * Any component in need to use an {@link ObjectStore} should created it through an implementation of this interface.
 * <p>
 * This manager works under the concept of &quot;Base Object Stores&quot;. This means that all created Object Stores
 * are actually partitions on these base stores. This manager is in charge of creating and handling such partitions
 * and exposing them as stand alone stores. There're two base object stores, one for the in memory ones and another for
 * the transient ones.
 * <p>
 * The reason why this manager operates in this way is to allow other services to override the default object store
 * implementations. A Core Extension can use the {@link CustomizationService} to override those base stores using
 * the {@link #BASE_IN_MEMORY_OBJECT_STORE_KEY} and {@link #BASE_PERSISTENT_OBJECT_STORE_KEY} keys. In addition to that,
 * this manager also has the concept of a default partition, which is the one for general use, for cases in which there's
 * no actual need to define a particular store. The default partition is unbounded and persistent.
 * <p>
 * All {@link ObjectStore} instances created through an instance of this interface, should also be destroyed through the
 * same instance using the {@link #disposeStore(String)} method. This does not mean that all stores should necessarily be
 * disposed. If you want that store to endure through time, then you should not dispose it.
 * <p>
 * Implementations are required to be thread-safe.
