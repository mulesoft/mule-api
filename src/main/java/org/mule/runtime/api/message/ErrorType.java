 * An {@code ErrorType} describes an type of error that may be thrown by a mule component.

 *
 * Every error belongs to a namespace {@see getNamespace} in order to avoid collisions of error
 * with the same string representation but that belong to different namespace {@see getNamespace}.
 *
 * Error types may be an specialization of a more general error type in which case the {@code getParentErrorType}
 * should return the more general error type. This is used when doing error type matching within error handlers
 * so when selecting the general error type for error handling it will also handle the more specialized error types.
