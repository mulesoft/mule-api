/**
 * A model which can be augmented with custom pieces of information
 * that are not part of the canonical introspection model. We call these
 * pieces {@link ModelProperty model properties}
 * <p>
 * This is useful for pieces of metadata which might not apply to all extensions
 * or might be specific to particular implementations.
 * <p>
 * Examples of a model property are the namespace URI and schema version for extensions
 * that support XML configuration, vendor specific information, custom policies, etc.
 * <p>
 * The values added as model properties must be of implementations of the {@link ModelProperty}
 * interface. As explained on the {@link ModelProperty} javadoc, those objects should be immutable.
 * This is because if a model definition keeps changing the runtime behaviour could become inconsistent.
 * They should also be thread-safe since several threads should be able to query the model safely.
