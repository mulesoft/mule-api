/**
 * An Extension that provides packaged functionality.
 * <p>
 * Extensions can augment a system by providing new features in the form of operations and connection providers.
 * What makes the extension model different from a class implementing a certain interface is the fact that extensions
 * provide enough information at runtime so that they can be used without prior knowledge, and can be both executed
 * or integrated into tooling seamlessly.
 * <p>
 * An extension model is not a miscellaneous group of methods, but can be seen (and may be derived from) an object model.
 * As such, an extension will provide several ways to configure itself and
 * will provide a set of operations that may be eventually executed.
 * <p>
 * The extension model doesn't just map a JVM object model. Extensions provide richer metadata, and a dynamic
 * execution model, but more importantly they restrict the way operations are defined and used to a
 * manageable subset that would deterministic data flow analysis.
 * <p>
 * An extension doesn't define any predefined syntax, evaluation order or execution paradigm. The operations provided
 * are expected to be used as individual building blocks in a bigger system, hence the name <code>Extension</code>
 *
 * @since 1.0
